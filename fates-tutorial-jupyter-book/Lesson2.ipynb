In our first example we will initialize the model with inventory data from the 50 ha ForestGEO plot on the island and run with a single tropical broadleaf evergreen tree PFT. We will run the model for 50 years and assess changes in the aboveground biomass, number of individuals, size structure, and growth and mortality rates through time.   \n",

Many history variables are output by default, but others we need to specify by listing them in the history_outputs file. If you open this file you will see many history outputs listed. The run_fates command takes the name of the history outputs file as an argument. We will learn how to visualise these history variables in lesson 3. \n"
