# Welcome to the FATES tutorial

This tutorial will introduce the FATES model and guide you through running it on your local machine. 
For this tutorial, we have created a FATES container that 
contains everything you need to need run a single point FATES simulation on your own computer or online. 
Lesson 1 guides you through setting up the FATES container. 
Lesson 2 provides an introduction to the different configurations of FATES and shows how to start an 
example simulation at a tropical forest site. 
In lesson 3 you will be guided through the FATES history outputs and how to make visualisations of the
simulation run in lesson 2. 
Finally, in lesson 4, we provide next steps for setting up a FATES simulation at your own site.   

#### What is FATES?

FATES is the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator. It is a  vegetation demographic  model 
that simulates the dynamics of vegetation (trees, shrubs and grasses) including recruitment, growth, 
competition for light and water, and mortality. FATES must run as a component of a host land model (HLM), 
currently the E3SM Land Model or ELM (https://e3sm.org/) and the Community Land Model or
CLM (https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM). 
In this tutorial the ELM host land model is included in the FATES container.


#### Useful resources

FATES development is primarily supported by the Department of  Energy's Office of Science, 
through the Next Generation Ecosystem  Experiment - Tropics ([NGEE-T](https://ngee-tropics.lbl.gov/)) project.
