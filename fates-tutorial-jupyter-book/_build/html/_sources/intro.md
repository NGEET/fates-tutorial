# Welcome to the FATES tutorial

This tutorial will introduce the FATES model and guide you through running it on your local machine. 
For the purposes of this tutorial, we have created a FATES container that 
contains everything you need to need run a single point FATES simulation on your own computer or online. 
Lesson 1 guides you through setting up the FATES container. 
Lesson 2 provides an introduction to the different configurations of FATES and shows how to start an 
example simulation at a tropical forest site. 
In lesson 3 you will be guided through the FATES history outputs and how to make visualisations of the
simulation run in lesson 2. 
Finally, in lesson 4, we provide next steps for setting up a FATES simulation at your own site.
