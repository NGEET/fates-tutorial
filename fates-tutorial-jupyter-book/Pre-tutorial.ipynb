The easiest way to do this is to use the ATFS data federation app to first convert your data into a standarised format. You can then use the R script provided with this notebook to convert it to the format that FATES needs.   "

The Data Federation App allows users to convert their data to a new format, either one of a number of standard formats associated with different plot networks, or a new custom format. \n",

The App will ask if you wish to do DBH taper corrections and taxonomic corrections. This is recocmmended but not essential for the purposes of the tutorial. \n",
