# User Guide for the FATES Tutorial 
==================================

Introduction to Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here Greg explains how to  install Docker and set  up the example FATES run



Inventory Initialization Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are three ways to start a FATES simulation. The first is a cold-start or bare-ground
simulation, in which the simulation begins with bare ground populated by recruits - plants of
the smallest size class at a density specified in the parameter file. In this case the model
has to be spun up for many years to get a forest that has a realistic size structure.
The second option is to use the restart file from a previous run as a starting point. FATES 
saves snapshots of the simulation at a frequency specified by the user as restart files, with
file extension .elm.r.YYYY-MM-DD.nc.
The final way to initialize FATES is with data from inventory plots on the size structure of the
forest.



Run Scripts and Terminal Commands
