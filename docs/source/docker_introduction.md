# Tutorial Setup

## Overview

This tutorial utilizes docker to provide the user a simplified method of setting up the necessary software to run fates.

Docker is an open-source project that allows programmers to deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system (Linux). Docker allows programmers to package an application with all of its dependencies (code, data, etc) into a standardized unit that other users can work with despite running different types of operating systems.

## Docker environment setup

1. Download Docker Desktop: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

Download the desktop version for your operating system.

2. Install Docker Desktop

3. Run the Docker "Hello World" test example

4. Download the tutorial repository: https://github.com/NGEET/fates-tutorial/

From the github website, find the link to download the repository under the green "code" button as shown below:

This can either be done by downloading the repository or using git to clone the respository.  This tutorial will not make use of git so you do not have to be familiar with its usage.

## Introduction to containers

### Docker Orientation

- What is Docker Desktop? Docker Desktop "enables developers to locally build, share, and run containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Build/BuildKit, Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, Docker Scan, and Credential Helper. Docker Desktop is for Mac and Windows and includes the Docker Dashboard for working with local and remote container images, Dev Environments and more new features are being delivered every month such as Volume Management."
