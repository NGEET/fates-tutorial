# FATES Tutorial Docker Image

This docker image uses official Jupyter stack images as it's base.

To build this image while allowing it to have full build context of the repo so as to be able to copy necessary files, run the following from the repo base directory:
```
docker buildx build -f containers/jupyter/Dockerfile --tag=<repo/imagename:tag> .
```
